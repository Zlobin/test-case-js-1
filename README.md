in general:
The task is to create a control library comprising two web controls (widgets) â€“ NumericInput and CalcInput. 
NumericInput is an input field that converts the text entered by the user to a numeric value, if possible.
CalcInput is similar to it, but allows the user to type arithmetical expressions like 5*(7+8)/2-7, and converts them to numeric values (if possible). Besides the input field it also contains an area where it shows the calculated value.
